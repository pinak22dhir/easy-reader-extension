# Easy paper reader extension
While reading neuroscience papers, I often swtich between multiple tabs - one tab for figures, one for methods, one for references, one for actually reading the text. This extension is an attempt towards solving this small load. 

## While reading paper, 
1. Highlight the figure number to see the figure
TODO - image
2. Highlight methods word to see Methods

3. Highlight reference number to see paper - title, authors abstract
